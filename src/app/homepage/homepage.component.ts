        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
          My name is <span class="color-transition">Gil Stettler</span>. I am 24 years old (born 23 June 2000). I am
          currently studying <span class="color-transition">business informatics</span> while working part-time as a
          <span class="color-transition">deputy application manager</span> at the Swiss Accreditation Service (SAS).
          <br /><br />
          At the SAS, I am responsible for ensuring that our application
          continues to meet the needs of the users and the conditions. However,
          prior to this job, I was able to gain a wide range of other work
          experience. At the State Secretariat for Migration (SEM) and the Swiss
          Accreditation Service, I was able to gain a lot of experience as an
          administrator. I am able to <span class="color-transition">adapt to different teams</span> and situations
          and always use my skills to add value. My ability to learn quickly and
          my qualitative way of working have always been of great help to me.
          <br /><br />
          I am interested in software projects that support organisations in
          their <span class="color-transition">digital transformation</span>. Software must always enable the user to
          create value and have great usability. I would like to use my skills
          in such projects. Be it as a requirements engineer, project manager,
          UI/UX designer, product owner or scrum master. Want to know more about
          me? Then I invite you to have a look at my portfolio!
